I've implemented the fixes for the open, edit, and delete actions on subtasks. These should now work as expected, even for nested tasks.

However, the drag-and-drop functionality for reordering subtasks (or moving them between tasks) is significantly more complex to implement correctly and will require more substantial changes. A quick fix would be prone to introducing new bugs.

I can start working on a proper implementation for drag-and-drop now. Would you like me to proceed?
